## Requirements
I'm easy going, the only thing I really need is PHP 5.3 or higher!

---

## Installation {#installation}
It's *really* easy.

- [Download the source files](https://github.com/timseverien/Felix/archive/master.zip) or [clone from Github](https://github.com/timseverien/Felix/)
- Move the files to your server
- Make sure to set the permissions right because I don't like getting [defaced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement).
